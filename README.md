# Final Milestone Project

## Consultation Page 
The beginnings of something great!
This Repo will be updated as the prject goes along!

#### Dependencies so far
node
react
express
mongoose

#### Seeders
To run the seed data in the project type node seeders/seed-consultInfo.js

#### Notes form the Developer
Progress is a little slow at the moment but as of right now the Database is going to be mongoDB until Sequelize feels like the better option. NewConsultForm is almost finished so i can make the schema for that next. Thanks for tuning in!

update: NewConsultForm on the front end has finally been completed and sends data to the backend. Next we will be working on user login and authentication. Stay tuned for the adventure.
