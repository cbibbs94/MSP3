#### Notes form the Developer
Progress is a little slow at the moment but as of right now the Database is going to be mongoDB until Sequelize feels like the better option. NewConsultForm is almost finished so i can make the schema for that next. Thanks for tuning in!

update: NewConsultForm on the front end has finally been completed and sends data to the backend. Next we will be working on user login and authentication. Stay tuned for the adventure.

update: Two days before deadline and we have a lot of work to do. Just Finished a Context component and i hope to make it better as i work on the project. Both databases have been set up and are working perfectly. hope to have a lot more done by tomorrow morning. 

update: Deadline is tomorrow!! Everything is working enough at the moment. need to tweak the JWT so the user stays logged in. Otherwise Functionality is done and now its time to make this thing PRETTY!!!!

update: Well Deadline is in 3 hours and i need to deploy. So this is the last update before presentation. Will work on styling more once presentations are over.
